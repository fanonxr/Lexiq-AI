# Shared Resources Configuration
# This file contains configuration for resources shared across all environments (dev, staging, prod)
# Copy this file to shared.tfvars and update with your actual values
# DO NOT commit shared.tfvars to version control if it contains sensitive information

# Project Configuration
project_name   = "lexiqai"  # Base name for all resources (must be lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens only)
azure_location = "westus"   # Azure region for shared resources (e.g., "eastus", "westus", "westus2")
                             # Should match your primary environment location for best performance

# DNS Configuration (Optional)
# Only configure if you're using Azure DNS to manage your domain
# Leave empty if using external DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, Route53, GoDaddy)
dns_zone_name = ""  # e.g., "lexiqai.com" or "example.com"
                    # If set, Azure DNS zone will be created in the shared resource group
                    # You'll need to update your domain registrar's name servers to point to Azure DNS

# GitHub Configuration
# These settings configure the GitHub OIDC application for CI/CD
github_repository = "fanonxr/Lexiq-AI"  # Your GitHub repository in format: owner/repo
                                         # Example: "your-org/your-repo" or "username/repo-name"

# GitHub Environments (Recommended)
# These should match the environments defined in your GitHub Actions workflow
# The workflow uses: dev, staging, prod
github_environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]

# Legacy Branch Support (Deprecated)
# Use github_environments instead. Only use this if you're not using GitHub environments.
# github_branch = "*"  # Options: "*" (all branches), "develop", "staging", "prod", "master"

# Environment Resource Group Names
# These should match the resource groups created by your environment-specific Terraform configs
# Format: {project_name}-rg-{environment}
environment_resource_group_names = {
  dev     = "lexiqai-rg-dev"      # Dev environment resource group
  staging = "lexiqai-rg-staging"  # Staging environment resource group
  prod    = "lexiqai-rg-prod"     # Production environment resource group
}

# Common Tags
# These tags will be applied to all shared resources
common_tags = {
  Project     = "LexiqAI"      # Project name
  ManagedBy   = "Terraform"    # Indicates infrastructure is managed by Terraform
  Environment = "shared"       # Environment identifier (always "shared" for shared resources)
  CostCenter  = "Engineering"  # Cost center for billing/accounting
  # Add any additional tags as needed:
  # Team       = "Platform"
  # Owner      = "devops@example.com"
  # Purpose    = "Shared infrastructure"
}

# Note: subscription_id and tenant_id are NOT required here
# They are automatically sourced from:
#   1. Environment variables: TF_VAR_subscription_id, TF_VAR_tenant_id
#   2. Azure CLI: az account show (if logged in)
#   3. .env file (if using make commands)
#
# To set manually:
# export TF_VAR_subscription_id="<your-subscription-id>"
# export TF_VAR_tenant_id="<your-tenant-id>"
